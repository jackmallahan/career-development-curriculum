# Agile Software Development Reflection

* The biggest thing that I have taken away from the Agile Work Practices is to use 'working software is the primary measure of progress.' This has really helped me when working with a partner celebrate each win. This is awesome because it gets us to constantly celebrate and keep a positive attitude. The other thing that I have used is having feedback conversations at regular intervals to make sure that we are always on the same page and working together!
