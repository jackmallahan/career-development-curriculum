# Feedback III Reflection

* What are you doing well as a pair programmer and collaborator?
-In all of my feedback, every partner has really appreciated the fact that I always keep the mood positive and push my partners to work their hardest. 


* How do you use your strengths as a team member?
-I use this positive energy to get the best work out of my teammates.



* How would you like to continue to develop your strengths?
-I want to continue to grow my technical skills more than my soft skills because I have always had a natural talent for teamwork.


* What would you like to improve on as a teammate? 
-I want to be better at not always being the leader. I think that I did a pretty good job when I worked with David to take more of a backseat than I am normally used to, but I think I can always grow as a teammate in a non-leadership position.


* How would you like your teammates to see you?
-I would like my teammates to see me as an intelligent leader.
