# Feedback II Reflection

* Date of feedback conversation: 7/20

* How did you prepare for the conversation? 
-Outlined a basic strategy of what I wanted to say to make sure that I conveyed all of my feedback succinctly and accurately.

* How did the conversation go for you? What was easy about the conversation? What was more difficult?
-The conversation went really well. I thought that it was easy to give the compliments to David because he does have so many attributes that are desirable in a partner. We worked really well as partners. I normally feel like I am in more of a driver role in a partnership but it was nice to let David take on more of the leadership role. Bringing that up was a little difficult because I didn't want him to feel like he bulldozed me at all, but he received it very well. 

* What principles of feedback did you use in the conversation?
-I used appreciation in our feedback conversation because we really had a great pairing and we had great communication throughout. 

* Any other comments: We did a really great job as a team.
