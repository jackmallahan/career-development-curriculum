# Documentation Guidelines for Cold Outreach I Deliverable:

* Name of contact
  * "The mentor (or alum) I contacted is Nick Chambers"

* Date of contact
  * "7/11/17"

* Outcome (i.e., did you get a response? If not, what is your follow-up plan? Did you meet? When? What was the result?)

  * We got together at Turing for a pairing session where he helped me with the array prototype reduce problems that I was having a hard time with. Then we talked for about 20 minutes about my concerns entering the workforce when I graduate. It was really great to have him to ask questions to. 

* How do you feel like this relationship will benefit you in your longterm professional development? 

  * This will definitely benefit me in my longterm professional development because Nick is a huge propenent of cold outreach and is a great asset for learning more about the job search process.
